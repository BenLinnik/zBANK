For the lecture Enterprise Mainframe Computing a project was developed
in collaboration. The project named “ZBANK” is an application written in
COBOL and uses CICS as a transaction monitor, BMS as a user interface
and a key-sequenced VSAM for data storage. In this document, we
summarize the program code and the work done.
